 * --snip--
 * Craft plugins are very much like little applications in and of themselves. We’ve made it as simple as we can,
 * but the training wheels are off. A little prior knowledge is going to be required to write a plugin.
 *
 * For the purposes of the plugin docs, we’re going to assume that you know PHP and SQL, as well as some semi-
 * advanced concepts like object-oriented programming and PHP namespaces.
